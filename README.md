# Warehouse

Hello and welcome to my project. It consists on a monorepo to access 
and modify products and inventories. 

## Getting started

#### System requirements

üí° The setup described here will involve <a href="https://www.docker.com//">Docker</a>. In order to follow this guide you'll need the service up and running on your system. You can find how to install it <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/"> here</a>.


#### Overview

The application relies on three containers running each service:
  - A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database.
  - The API served with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) web application 

## Setting up the project
‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you are in the repos root directory before you start the setup. 


- #### General

    First of all, we will create a docker network to allow the containers to communicate with each other:

    ```bash
    # Creation of Docker network named `warehouse`
    docker network create --gateway=172.21.0.1 --subnet=172.21.0.0/16 warehouse

    # The network should when listed
    docker network list
    ```

- #### üóÑ Database

  - ##### Building the image

    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache . -f db.Dockerfile -t warehousedb
    ```
  - ##### Running the container

    ```bash
    # Note the IPv4 assignment for the API server database configuration parameters
    docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --network warehouse --ip 172.21.0.10 --name warehousedb warehousedb
    ```

  - ##### Access to the psql command line tool

    ```bash
    # You might want to check that the database initialised correctly
    docker exec -it warehousedb psql -U warehouse     
    ...
    warehouse=# \l
    warehouse=# \d
    warehouse=# SELECT * FROM articles;
    warehouse=# SELECT * FROM products;
    ...
    # To close the connection just type 'exit' and press `Enter`
    warehouse=# exit
    ```

- #### ‚öôÔ∏è API

  - ##### Building the image
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache . -f api.Dockerfile -t warehouseapi
    ```
  - ##### Running the container
    ```bash
    # Note two things:
    #  - the use of a volume to apply local changes to the container
    #  - the IPv4 assignment for the React client requests to the API
    docker run -v "$(pwd)/warehouse-api/src:/warehouse-api/src" -d -p 3000:3000 --network warehouse --ip 172.21.0.11 --name warehouseapi warehouseapi
    ```

  - ##### Testing the API
    You'll be able to access the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) API docs [here](http://localhost:3000/warehouse/api/docs/)

- #### üíª Web application
  
  - ##### Building the image
    ```bash
    docker build --no-cache . -f web.Dockerfile -t warehouseweb
    ```
  - ##### Running the container
    ```bash
    # Note two things:
    #  - the use of a volume to apply local changes to the container
    #  - the IPv4 assignment for the React client requests to the API
    docker run -d -p 3100:3100 --network warehouse --ip 172.21.0.12 --name warehouseweb warehouseweb
    ```
## Next steps & missing points

  - Unit testing is used in some helpers and functions in the API, but the web application comes with a lack of testing. I would have liked to at least implement a few integration tests regarding fetching and presenting the data, and the product sale operation.
  - This happened due to the investment of a considerable amount of time modelling the database, the constraints and the implementation of lock system. I have to admit I experimented some problems (üëÄ) understanding how to lock rows with Sequelize and struggled with the official documentation about that matter.
  - Nonetheless, figuring out a workaround to address the consistency of the data and the atomicity of its operations proved to be a fun challenge.
  - I also wanted to merge all the setup and Docker stuff within a docker-compose.yaml file but I ran out of time. 
  - To finish, it would have been nice to finish the implementation of adding and editing new articles and products.
  - Aaaaand that's a wrap... Feel free to reach me for any inquiry or question.
